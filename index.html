		<h1>Background</h1>
		<p>I accessed this data from the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC). They are a non-profit organization that was founded in 1990 and serves the public with analysis and information about capital punishment in the United States. In 1972, the U.S. Supreme court struck down all use of the death penalty following the Supreme court ruling on Furman v. Georgia. Soon after, many states rewrote their laws in order to overcome the Supreme court's concerns - and as can be seen in the chart below, since 1976, the number of people on death row in the U.S. has had an upward trend. From 1976 until 2011, 1,264 people have been executed on death row.</p>

<h1>Death By State</h1>
<p>California has more inmates on death row than any other state - a little over 45% of their inmates are on death row (per 100,000 of total population). Although they CA has a large percentage of their prison population on death row, they do not actually carry out executions at the rate of other states like Texas (leads U.S. in executions). Part of the issue, is that in 2006, a moratorium was put in place that stopped all executions in CA. That was lifted 2010. Despite the lift, no executions have taken place in CA since 2006 due partly to the fact that the state is unable to acquire the drugs needed to carry out executions.</p>

<h1>Who Gets Executed?</h1>
<p>Only 12 women have been executed since 1976. However race is an issue that comes up in the death penalty debate. Historically, black and white individuals are executed at the higest rates among any race. However, if you compare black and white individuals as a porportion of the U.S. population, then it becomes clear that more black Americans get executed.</p>
